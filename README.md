# MS Project – Project Planning & Delivery Management

## Overview
This project demonstrates how MS Project can be used beyond basic scheduling to support real-world project delivery. The focus is on improving visibility, managing dependencies, controlling change during execution, and generating actionable project insights rather than static information.

The objective was to build a realistic project plan that supports informed decision-making, timely delivery, and sustainable resource utilisation.

---

## Key Project Objectives
- Create a structured and realistic project schedule  
- Improve visibility of task dependencies and critical activities  
- Track changes during execution using baselines  
- Manage resource allocation to avoid conflicts and burnout  
- Generate clear project insights for planning and decision-making  

---

## Project Planning & Scheduling Approach

### Project Calendar Setup
- Defined a project calendar to reflect realistic working days and hours  
- Ensured task schedules aligned with actual working constraints  
- Improved accuracy of timelines and milestone forecasting  

### Task Structuring & Milestones
- Broke down work into clearly defined tasks and milestones  
- Used milestone tasks to track key delivery points  
- Applied outline numbers to create a logical project hierarchy  
- Improved readability and navigation across the project plan  

---

## Dependency & Task Relationship Management
- Defined task relationships (Finish-to-Start, Start-to-Start where applicable)  
- Identified how delays in one task could impact dependent activities  
- Used dependency mapping to understand knock-on effects across the project  
- Improved sequencing to reduce scheduling conflicts  

---

## Baseline Setting & Change Tracking

### Baseline Management
- Set a baseline to capture the original approved project plan  
- Used the baseline as a reference point during execution  
- Enabled comparison between planned and actual progress  

### Monitoring During Execution
- Measured schedule and scope changes against the baseline  
- Identified early deviations that could affect delivery timelines  
- Improved control over incremental changes during the Execution Process  

---

## Resource Allocation & Workload Management
- Assigned resources to tasks to reflect realistic ownership  
- Reviewed resource allocation to identify over-allocation and conflicts  
- Used resource views to rebalance workloads where necessary  
- Supported sustainable delivery by reducing the risk of team burnout  
- Improved confidence in delivery timelines by aligning capacity with demand  

---

## Task Visibility & Detail Management
- Used highlighting and filtering to focus on priority tasks  
- Filtered tasks based on status, milestones, and constraints  
- Reduced noise by surfacing only relevant activities at key points in time  
- Improved the ability to respond quickly under time pressure  

---

## Reporting & Project Insights

### Reporting Focus
- Reviewed built-in project reports to assess schedule, progress, and resources  
- Focused on extracting insights rather than producing excessive information  

### Insight-Driven Decision Making
- Ensured project health could be understood quickly and clearly  
- Prioritised reports that provide an overview suitable for planning  
- Enabled both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand project status  
- Supported proactive decision-making instead of reactive problem-solving  

---

## Key Learnings
- Project delays often stem from lack of visibility, not lack of effort  
- Small changes can significantly impact delivery if not tracked properly  
- Attention to detail in planning makes a measurable difference during execution  
- Resource management is critical to both delivery performance and team wellbeing  
- Effective project tools should simplify decision-making, not overwhelm users  

---

## Conclusion
This project reinforced that MS Project is most effective when used deliberately to manage dependencies, change, and resource constraints in dynamic project environments. When applied correctly, it supports clarity, control, and informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.
